hidden-single__explanation-1: "Hidden single is when in row, column or block candidate can be only found in one cell. In this case lets focus on {0}."
hidden-single__explanation-2: "When we filter value {0:D} we can notice that in {1} it can go only to {2}. Still don't see it?"
hidden-single__explanation-3: "Other cells already have different values or don't have {0:D} as candidate. Only place where {1:D} can go in {2} is cell {3}."
